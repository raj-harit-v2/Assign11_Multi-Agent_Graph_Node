### Execution Flow

Query → Memory Search → Perception → Decision → Plan Graph → Node Execution Loop → Final Answer

### Core 
- Graph-Native Execution: Execution plans are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Node-Based Processing: Each execution step is a node with multiple code variants (A, B, C)
- Dynamic Replanning: System can generate fallback nodes on failure
- Enhanced Memory: Vector embeddings, session caching, and question word indexing



## Overview

Assignment 11 represents an evolution from a sequential multi-agent system (Assign10) to a graph-native agent system with DAG-based execution planning. The system transforms linear plan execution into a dynamic graph structure, enabling parallel execution paths, automatic fallback mechanisms, and multiple code variant retries.

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Paradigm
- **Graph-Native Execution**: Execution plans are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- **Node-Based Processing**: Each execution step is a node with multiple code variants (A, B, C)
- **Dynamic Replanning**: System can generate fallback nodes on failure
- **Enhanced Memory**: Vector embeddings, session caching, and question word indexing

### Execution Flow
```
Query → Memory Search → Perception → Decision → Plan Graph → Node Execution Loop → Final Answer

Assign11 transforms the multi-agent system from a **sequential executor** into a **graph-native intelligent planner**. The DAG structure enables dynamic execution paths, automatic error recovery, and enhanced memory utilization, making the system more robust, efficient, and capable of handling complex queries with multiple execution strategies.
